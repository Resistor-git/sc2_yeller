Yells at you if you fail your macro in Starcraft 2

## To start the program:
- open the folder containing 'main.py' in your terminal
- run using command `py main.py` (Windows) or `python3 main.py` (Linux)

## How it works
SC2 Yeller takes screenshots and analyzes the information on them. The program plays an audio message if you have too many resources or do not use your supply wisely.
